A presence in the bed makes you forget about the stressful situations at work or about worries ans duties. When you see someone loved sleeping next to you, you realize that those problems are not worth worrying about. Yes, it can be explained scientifically but it doesn\u2019t have to. It\u2019s just that, when we feel lonely in bed, we lose desire to have a peaceful, healthy sleep. But when somebody is with us, we cherish those moments and sleep along with them. Simple.",

In broad strokes, Introverts have high baseline levels of cognitive stimulation and arousal even at rest and thus are constantly trying to avoid any additional visual and social stimuli. So when they're trying to concentrate, nearby noises or people are additional stimuli that becomes distracting and pushes them over their optimal level of arousal. Extraverts, on the other hand, are at a constant arousal deficit and require extra stimuli to compensate and bring them to their optimal level. So they seek out places with lots of people, loud music, or interesting visuals. ",

The language of category theory has become part of standard mathematical discourse even among mathematicians who don't use the results of category theory itself. Few mathematicians employ the Yoneda lemma, but every mathematician understands what \u201cfunctor\u201d means. The only reasons I can imagine why you'd think there's any controversy are:You may have heard the term \u201cabstract nonsense\u201d. This is a light-hearted, tongue-in-cheek reference to the universal aspect of category theory. It doesn't signify a controversy regarding either the validity or the significance of any category-theoretic argument. It takes some care to set up the set-theoretic foundations of category theory, which naively deals with proper classes such as \u201cthe category of all groups\u201d. This isn't hard to do, and doesn't leave the theory in a foundational crisis.",

Sufferers are often riddled with persistent and recurrent impulses, thoughts and images that are unwanted.

Severe cases of OCD can cause an extreme amount of distress, and the disorder can dramatically interfere with a person\u2019s daily life. Sufferers of OCD are generally very anxious and emotional. They display many non- OCD symptoms, such as signs of depression, excessive worry,extreme tension, and the constant feeling that nothing is ever right. Aside from the obvious compulsive behaviors a person with OCD displays, there are no physical signs of this disorder; however, a person with OCD can develop physical problems. For example, a person with a germ obsession may wash their hands so much that the skin on them becomes red, raw and painful. A person with OCD may experience multiple short-term effects, including the inability to function as a contributing member of society, difficulties at school or work,or trouble maintaining friendships or romantic relationships. The long-term effects of OCD generally develop due to the poor quality of life that most extreme sufferers have. Long-term effects include depression, constant anxiety and an increased risk of substance abuse.",

If you go out, make sure you have snacks and drink, and do not go out at nap time. Offer food before the meltdown, hand her a drink, put her down for a nap before she gets over tired. This will pass, but ONLY if it never works. By that I mean, never give in to the tantrum. If you are out somewhere and she starts, calmly pick her up. Say this is not a good way to behave, carry her back to your car and go home. If that means leaving a full cart of groceries, so be it. If she does it at home, ignore her, but keep her safe. By that I mean do not let her throw things or crash into things. I used to sit on the floor and pull my child into my arms, my legs over hers, my arms crossed over her arms. I wasn't holding her down, I was holding her safe. I didn't talk to her during this, stayed calm, and I kept my head up so she couldn't head butt me. Once she realizes that tantrums will not get her what she wants, she will stop, and it probably won't even take too long. I had five children, but only had to deal with this a few times. I think the older ones told the younger ones to forget it, as it didn't work. With children, you can say no 99 times. If you say yes once, the child will only learn that it worked once, and will keep trying the behavior you don't like. Be strong, be consistent and stay calm. My kids would sometimes yell, I hate you! I would reply, that's okay, I love you. I'd hear, You're mean! I'd reply, yes, I am, but I love you. See the humor in it and know it's just a passing phase. Good luck!",

I will, however, assume you are referring to Queen Elizabeth II, the Queen of the United Kingdom and Head of the Commonwealth. She was christened Elizabeth Alexandra Mary. Even then, whilst her father was the Duke of York, she would not have had a conventional surname in the same way as the rest of us. Had her father not become King, she would have remained Princess Elizabeth of York in the same way that the current Duke of York\u2019s daughters are Princess Beatrice of York and Princess Eugenie of York. In recent times it has become more usual for such ducal names to be adopted as surnames in certain, less formal, situations. For example as Charles is the Prince of Wales, his sons would be Prince William (or Henry - Harry\u2019s real name) of Wales, but when they entered the armed forces, and probably, also at school, they were known as William Wales and Harry Wales. The Queen doesn't need a surname, who else in the world could anyone mean when referring to Queen Elizabeth the second?",

A large proportion of bigoted, homophobic or just plain stupid questions are posted by anonymous and a large portion of questions posed by anonymous are bigoted, homophobic or just plain stupid.

However you find that the answer or topic has popular support among fellow Quorans and you reporting it would not do anything. Also by commenting against it you are susceptible to earn ire of those who support it and even get a BNBR warning depending upon how intensely you express your emotions. So to all those Quora newbies right here reading this I would recommend you to use the mute button Quora to block certain topics and people whom you feel are worthy of it. I am recommending this feature under little known tricks because I myself was a newbie user about a month ago and was very much pissed at the sight of some answer which gained sympathy among fellow Quorans for no reason.

Here's the thing: Windows has gotten a LOT better about isolating installations properly and cleaning up after uninstallations... but at the end of the day careless developers are careless developers -- big software houses and small. These \"artifacts\" add up, and that -- as well as unnecessarily running background processes and settings that you may have never intended to change -- are what causes the system to become sluggish. The best way to guard against this is to pay attention to what you are installing and, even then, to install \"responsibly\". My golden rule?

Since reading requires concentration -- it's practically impossible to multi-task if you are absorbed in a good book -- there will be times that are better suited to reading than others. Lying in bed at night is a traditional time for reading. If you commute on public transit, have a lunch hour without work to be done or friends to visit -- all good times.

Little time left after the school, homework and extracurricular activities (dance, music, karate classes etc), is spent on browsing or watching TV!Where's the time to make friends? So, forget about true friends!. Even if they make some friends, they are looked upon more as their competitors than buddies!. Thank you!",

And even with those it is not easy. I think it\u2019s around 5% admission rate these days, and the fact that the school offers free tuition if your parents earn less than $90K a year has something to do with that. If you don\u2019t have top grades, then you need to be a top athlete in some sport that the school wishes to recruit. The most surefire way to get in is\u2026be the child of faculty. Seriously. Faculty brings in research dollars to the University and their children are on a different list for admission than others. Another helpful tip is if you are applying from an area that does not have alot of applications. Stanford likes to be geographically diverse. I applied while living in Minnesota, which meant that there was less competition. If you are applying from a state like California\u2014well alot of people apply to stanford and it is more competitive.",

It isn't. All that's required for a new variant of a species to emerge from an evolutionary process is for that variant to occur and survive over time. That can happen whether the ancestor species sticks around or not. What makes this non-obvious is that most species don't survive long-term; the vast, vast majority of species that have existed on Earth are extinct now. So if you look back, chances are that any given ancestor of any given modern species is long gone. But that's not necessarily because it was replaced per se. Rather, it probably coexisted for quite a long time with its descendant, gradually dying out for whatever reason (possibly, but not necessarily, including being outcompeted for scarce resources -- it's definitely true that competition plays a big role) until only the more recent species remained. Viewed from afar, this looks a bit like \"species A transformed into species B\" but that's just a conceptual shortcut, not the actual mechanism at work.",

You might wonder how 'Scales' could probably help - this is because you are so familiar with make accurate sounds, your skill of picking, sliding, hammer-ons & pull-offs become almost effortless. You also might want to practice a lot to learn faster. If you like a song, go over the chords again and again. Practice is vital & the sure-shot way to learn faster and better.

All in all, Western society is going down the toilet. As Ifeoluwapo Eleyinafe put it in a comment a little while ago: \u201cMy vote is for [Western civilization] flying off the handle. Once words begin to degrade, it\u2019s only a matter of time. Once truth is forgotten and no one is humble before it or fighting for it, it\u2019s only a matter of time.\u201d",

It will also list any similar images that google finds below any exact results. In order for this to work, the image has to be index in the google search engines so if a photo is recently uploaded it would not even appear for a while.  More so, it may take time for that image to spread socially and be tagged with more information about who the subject may be.  However if the subject is never mentioned and it is not self evident by the page that the images is hostel on, then there is no technical way of knowing.  You will then have to become a photo sleuth.

There is no traumatic experience, that destroys the ability to handle love and intimacy so totally and utterly as sexual abuse. That is, why, after the suicide of Anja (my first partner, who was sexually abused by her father) I swore myself an oath, that I would stick up for victims. That is my mission on Quora. To raise consciousness about the devastating effects of sexual abuse. If you have no ability, to handle intimacy, no capacity to trust people; if you blame yourself for the abuse; if you feel inferior, and deeply ashamed of yourself, live is very, very hard. We, as a society, should do everything in our power, to help victims heal, to help them, to support them. To make them feel welcome, to keep their hope alive. To go out of our way, to establish trust with them. To prove to them, that not all men are abusers. To help them to regain the capacity to trust. So that they ultimately can develop friendships, or a love relationship, with a loving caring partner, who is in it for the long haul. Greetings, and I wish all readers a life with real love, real intimacy, and respectful sexuality!",

            "text": "To me, it makes more sense to go with a procedure which is permanent rather than something which is temporary, such as waxing, trimming, shaving etc. The more ideal option would be permanent hair reduction through laser, or electrolysis. In both cases, the hair will not recur after the completion of the procedure.*Electrolysis is a bit more protracted than laser, and can be painful, as it involves passing a mild electric shock through each hair (individually) so as to destroy the hair follicle. On the other hand, laser hair removal entails a high pulse laser beam being directed at the follicle of the root, causing its destruction and thereby preventing hair from sprouting again. Laser removal is almost painless and might be accompanied by redness and soreness of skin, at a mild level. Both procedures ideally require multiple sittings before they are completed satisfactorily. Both methods are perfectly safe to be used on pubic as well as underarm regions of your body. The one catch with laser is - it works best on skin of light complexion and hair which is thicker and darker, than vice versa, while the same does not apply to electrolysis. Regarding hair removal creams, they may or may not cause darkening - it depends upon the chemical composition of the product, and your reaction to it. Some people attempt to counteract the darkening using hydroquinone or mequinol (with renin) subsequent to darkening (both chemicals used for tropical depigmentation).I think I've addressed the issue adequately. *In case of electrolysis, there will be no recurrence of hair, but in case of laser hair removal, there are minor chances of hair recurrence, especially triggered by hormone changes, among other factors. Please consult with a qualified expert dermatologist before making a final decision as to which procedure you wish to undergo.",

Take it slowly on yourself. If you have been living a sedentary lifestyle then start with jogging, then start running.

You can use different cardio machine or go swimming, or just skip. The key is to constantly keep challenging yourself. Then only you will see a increase in stamina. Yes , if you stop challenging yourself over long period of time . Your stamina will remain same or it will decrease and you have to start from scratch.

Entrepreneurs find opportunities to fulfill the needs or wants of other people for a profit. This means that you first need to discover an opportunity, which you can do through research, then figure out the cost of the product or service that will fulfill the underlying need (by doing some more research), then calculating a price at which people would be willing to buy it, and give you enough profit to grow the business. In some ways being an entrepreneur is really just about having a conversation with a specific group of people (your market). You first find out what they need, and when you deliver a solution they may or may not like it. If they don\u2019t like it you go back to the drawing board and figure out better ways to solve the need they may have. If they do like your solution, your task it so make sure that they keep on buying from you.

It is directly contrasted with naturalism, which posits either that no spiritual realm exists, or that no spiritual realm needs to exist. Many people make the mistake of assuming naturalism to be opposed to theism, but there are naturalistic theists in the world, particularly in less modernised nations. These are people who believe a god exists in the natural world, in apex predator forms, as a human ruler, and/or even in inanimate objects like the earth. Ancient Aztecs were naturalistic theists, who worshipped a pantheon of natural gods, which include the sun, moon, king, and famously, Quetzalcoatl, the avian god. Incidentally, one thing they got right was that birds and reptiles are related\u2026 something only discovered centuries later to be true through fossil records, though this could simply have been a lucky guess\u2026 or an unrecorded observation of an ancient fossil of a transitional species. Most naturalistic theist beliefs have been supplanted by modern science, while spiritualism, due to its nature, is impossible by definition to disprove. Thus most modern religions that persist today are spiritualist in form, though spiritualistic atheism is also similarly impossible to disprove.",
